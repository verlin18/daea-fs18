Map Intro (100 words)

Naga ed-Deir is a large mortuary site that was primarily excavated between 1900 and 1925 by George Reisner, an American archaeologist. Despite a high degree of disturbance, the tombs there can be placed in the Old Kingdom through the Middle Kingdom (including the first intermediate period) thanks to pottery and scarab seriation.
